This plugin will allow site admins to create challenges and then participants can enter their activity.

== Description ==

This plugin does not require but works well with membership plugins.  The admin can create a challenge, share the challenge link with whom they wish.  Those wishing to participate can click on the link and opt to join the challenge. Once the participant has joined the challenge, they can enter activity against that challenge upto daily and receive points.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Extract the 'point-tracker.zip' file in the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory or install using the plugin installer in WP
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. The Point Tracker admin menu is used to administer the challenges, its activities, and participants.
4. Navigate to the Point Tracker -> Point Tracker admin menu
5. Fill out the form and create a challenge (add a name, start and end dates, and a description) then click "Save"
6. Copy the link that appears just above the description box
7. Navigate to the Point Tracker -> Activities admin menu
8. Select the challenge you just created from the drop down

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is the coordinator portion behind the admin? =

I felt the creation or modification of a challenge was an administrative function and so it deserved to be behind the
admin dashboard.  If you want to allow another user on your site to create or modify a challenge, they will have to have
the 'manage_options' permission set.

= What happens if I initially set a challenge for approval required, then change it? =

The challenge will automatically approve all pending participants and any future participants will automatically be approved

= Once the challenge is over what happens? =

You will need to visit the Point Tracker -> Participants page to see who has the most points

= A participant entered some wrong information, what do I do? =

You can either delete it yourself or if they visit the View My Activity page (/my-activity/?chal={linkcode}), they will be able to delete it themselves

= What is a "hidden" activity? =

This is an activity that will not be scored.  The points will be defaulted to 0.  They will also not be displayed on any public displays other than the challenge form asking the user for their answer.  They are ideal for collecting information like feedback that you don't necessarily want to reward.

= What is an activity "group"? =

Activity groups allow you to group the activities into sections with a header.  This allow the participants to more easily find the questions they are wanting to answer.  They are optional.

= How can I create a custom page =

After you've created a challenge, copy the unique code for that challenge.  Create a new page at Pages -> Add New.  Give it a name and whatever content you'd like.  Then where you'd like to put the challenge form simply type `[challenge chal={challenge code you copied}][/challenge]`, then publish the page.  That is all.  You can also create an activity page using the shortcode `[my_activity chal={code}][/my_activity]`.

= I'd like a leader board =

One will be available in Point Tracker Pro releasing soon
